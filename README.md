# Zoomcar

Car/bike rentals application

**Problem statement**

As discussed, I would like you to work on a basic spring boot application. 

You will be writing APIs for a vehicle leasing software (ex: zoomcar)
The application maintains inventory of cars, that can be booked for renting. A customer can call following apis

- list vehicles (all, by type (e.g. sedan, hatchback etc.))
- book a vehicle,
- view past bookings

Use tech stack of your choice, in-memory persistence would be just fine - if you can demonstrate JPA great.

Some evaluation parameters:

1. Instructions on how to build and run. 
2. Spring integration tests.
3. Exception handling.
4. Usage of right response codes.
5. Signs of extensible solution. 
6. Any indication of design patterns. 

**Solution**
